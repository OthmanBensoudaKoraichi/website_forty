# **Description**

I developed a bot for my family business Agecap, the first online health insurance quote generator in Morocco, using Streamlit. This app features an advanced chatbot powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which efficiently connects to a client database and a database of quotes. Users can easily receive automated, personalized quotes, while the chatbot enhances the user experience with real-time responses. I also led the entire marketing strategy, including Facebook ads, designing the campaigns and communication. These efforts resulted in a 30x increase in leads and reduced the cost per lead by 10 times compared to the market average in Morocco.
