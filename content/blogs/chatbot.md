# **Description**

In this project, I developed a chatbot that recommends movies based on user preferences, using collaborative filtering and sentiment analysis. The chatbot processes user inputs, extracting movie titles and determining the sentiment associated with the movies mentioned. By analyzing the user's feedback on several films, the chatbot provides personalized recommendations using a binarized matrix of movie ratings. I also implemented creative features, such as handling misspelled movie titles and offering a creative mode for a more engaging interaction. This project showcases how natural language processing and machine learning can enhance user experiences in movie recommendations.
